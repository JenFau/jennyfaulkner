In 2020, when I first set up this site in Wordpress, I wrote:

This is still my passion, and a personal strength, but for the past couple of years my role has directed me firstly towards the quantitative side of business analysis and then towards AI. The latter is moving so quickly that I'm interested to see how things develop. 

I also wrote in the original 'about' page: 

> I'm two years into a part time analytical philosophy degree. 

I've now graduated from that degree (with first class honours) and finishing it - in theory, at least - gave me time to explore some more of my many, many interests. So in June 2025 I started a [digital garden](https://notes.jennyfaulkner.com) - an informal place to capture and develop thoughts. The plan was - and is - that as those thoughts become more developed, they would become pages on this site. This has not happened as yet, and I'm refreshing this website today as part of kicking that off. 

On the subject of philosophy, I also wrote:

> Philosophy teaches you to **think**, and what could be better than that?

I'm still fascinated by the way that humans think - or, in fact, seemingly often *don't* think. And, with the rise of AI now performing so much of the linear 'thinking' that has been taught for so long, how humans will need to develop their own models of thinking to more critically engage with AI. So, that's a starting point for exploration. 

On the subject of thinking differently, I have, within the the past three years, discovered why it has always seem to me that I *do* think differently to others. That new self knowledge and, just a few months later, coming to faith after many years of heavy scepticism, has been truly transformative - every aspect of my life has changed and improved: my approach to life, performance at work and my relationships. 

Finally, five years ago I wrote: 

> I prefer coffee to tea, books to parties, and I'm happiest when I'm by the sea. 

And *that*, my friends, hasn't changed at all...
